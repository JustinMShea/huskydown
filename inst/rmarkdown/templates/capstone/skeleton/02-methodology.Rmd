### Code chunks {.unnumbered}

When you click the **Knit** button above a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded code chunks within the document. You can embed a code chunk like this (`sleep` is a built-in **R** dataset. Student (1908) _The probable error of the mean_. Biometrika, 6, 20).

```{r cars-summary}
data(sleep)
summary(sleep)
```

However, one is not restricted to R and can use the following languages:

```{r languages}
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```

Of these, if you _must_ use `python`, you can do that too!
First load reticulate and then find what path your python resides on.

```{r load-recticulate}
library(reticulate)

pyPath <- py_discover_config()
pyPath 
```

Pass the relevant path to the `use_python` function.

```{r python-setup}
use_python(pyPath$python_versions[1])
```

Before we install some packages, we need to create a `conda` envioronment to store them in.
```{r}
# create a new environment 
conda_create("r-reticulate")
```

Install  packages:

```{r}
py_install("numpy")
```

Import packages:

```{r}
numpy <- import("numpy")
```

```{python}
import numpy as np
print(np.reshape(np.arange(1,25), (4,3,2), "F"))
```

Or you can use C++. Rcpp enables compilation of C++ into R functions.

```{Rcpp}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector humanPercent(NumericVector x) {
  return x * 100;
}
```

Now, `humanPercent` is available to call from R.

```{r}
humanPercent(x=0.0274)
```


### Inline code {.unnumbered}

If you'd like to put the results of your analysis directly into your discussion, add inline code like this:

> The `cos` of $2 \pi$ is "r cos(2*pi)". To execute, replace quotes with backticks (`).

> The `cos` of $2 \pi$ is `r cos(2*pi)`. 

Another example would be the direct calculation of the standard deviation:

> The standard deviation of `speed` in `cars` is "r sd(cars$speed)".

> The standard deviation of `speed` in `cars` is `r sd(cars$speed)`.

One last neat feature is the use of the `ifelse` conditional statement which can be used to output text depending on the result of an **R** calculation:

> r ifelse(sd(cars$speed) < 6, "The standard deviation is less than 6.", "The standard deviation is equal to or greater than 6.")

> `r ifelse(sd(cars$speed) < 6, "The standard deviation is less than 6.", "The standard deviation is equal to or greater than 6.")`

Note the use of `>` here, which signifies a quotation environment that will be indented.

As you see with `$2 \pi$` above, mathematics can be added by surrounding the mathematical text with dollar signs.  More examples of this are in [Mathematics and Science] if you uncomment the code in [Math].  

### Including plots {.unnumbered}

You can also embed plots.  For example, here is a way to use the base **R** graphics package to produce a plot using the built-in `pressure` dataset:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo=FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the **R** code that generated the plot.  There are plenty of other ways to add chunk options.  More information is available at <http://yihui.name/knitr/options/>.  


### Loading and exploring data {.unnumbered}

Next, we need to download the package `pnewflights14` for all flights that departed from Seattle and Portland in 2014. More information about this dataset and the **R** package is available at <http://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14>.  This subset includes only Portland flights and only rows that were complete with no missing values.  Merges were also done with the `airports` and `airlines` data sets in the `pnwflights14` package to get more descriptive airport and airline names.

We can load in this data set using the following command:

```{r load_data}
if(!require(pnwflights14)){ devtools::install_github("ismayc/pnwflights14")
}
library(pnwflights14)
data(flights)
```

The data is now stored in the data frame called `flights` in **R**.  To get a better feel for the variables included in this dataset we can use a variety of functions. Here we can see the dimensions (rows by columns) and also the names of the columns.

```{r str}
dim(flights)
names(flights)
```

Another good idea is to take a look at the dataset in table form. With this dataset has `r dim(flights)[1]` rows, we won't explicitly show the results of the command here.  I recommend you enter the command into the Console **_after_** you have run the **R** chunks above to load the data into **R**.

```{r view_flights, eval=FALSE}
View(flights)
```

While not required, it is highly recommended you use the `dplyr` package to manipulate and summarize your data set as needed.  It uses a syntax that is easy to understand using chaining operations.  Below I've created a few examples of using `dplyr` to get information about the Portland flights in 2014.  You will also see the use of the `ggplot2` package, which produces beautiful, high-quality academic visuals.

We begin by checking to ensure that needed packages are installed and then we load them into our current working environment:

```{r include_packages_2, include = FALSE}
# makes sure additional packages are included.
if(!require(dplyr))
    install.packages("dplyr", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
if(!require(ggplot2))
    install.packages("ggplot2", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
if(!require(knitr))
    install.packages("knitr", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
```

```{r load_pkgs, message=FALSE}
# Load packages (phoenixdown will load all of the packages as well)
library(phoenixdown)
# List of packages required for this analysis
pkg <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr", "bookdown", "devtools")
# Check if packages are not installed and assign the
# names of the packages not installed to the variable new.pkg
new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]

# If there are any packages in the list that aren't installed,
# install them
if (length(new.pkg))
  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")


```

The example we show here does the following:

- Selects only the `carrier` and `arr_delay` from the `flights` dataset and then determine the largest arrival delay for each of the carriers.

- merges with the airlines data set to match airlines names with carrier codes.

```{r max_delays}
data(flights)
data(airlines)

max_delays <- flights[,c("carrier", "arr_delay")] %>% 
              group_by(carrier) %>%
              summarize(max_arr_delay = max(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

max_delays <- merge(airlines, max_delays, by = "carrier")[,-1]
 
```

A useful function in the `knitr` package for making nice tables in _R Markdown_ is called `kable`.  It is much easier to use than manually entering values into a table by copying and pasting values into Excel or LaTeX.  This again goes to show how nice reproducible documents can be! (Note the use of `results="asis"`, which will produce the table instead of the code to create the table.)  The `caption.short` argument is used to include a shorter title to appear in the List of Tables.

```{r maxdelays, results="asis"}
data("airlines")

kable(max_delays,
      col.names = c("Airline", "Max Arrival Delay"),
      caption = "Maximum Delays by Airline",
      caption.short = "Max Delays by Airline",
      longtable = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

The last two options make the table a little easier-to-read.

We can further look into the properties of the largest value here for American Airlines Inc.  To do so, we can isolate the row corresponding to the arrival delay of 1539 minutes for American in our original `flights` dataset.


```{r max_props}
 kable(flights %>% filter(arr_delay == 1539, carrier == "AA") %>%
                   select(-c(month, day, carrier, hour, minute, arr_delay))
                   )
```

We see that the flight occurred on March 3rd and departed a little after 2 PM on its way to Dallas/Fort Worth.  Lastly, we show how we can visualize the arrival delay of all departing flights from Portland on March 3rd against time of departure.

```{r march3plot, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
flights %>% filter(month == 3, day == 3) %>%
            ggplot(aes(x = dep_time, y = arr_delay)) + 
            geom_point()
```

\TeX\ is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed \TeX\ when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics.  One nice feature of _R Markdown_ is its ability to read LaTeX code directly.

Get around math mode's automatic italicizing in LaTeX by using the argument `$\mathrm{formula here}$`, with your formula inside the curly brackets.  (Notice the use of the backticks here which enclose text that acts as code.)

So, $\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}$ is written `$\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}$`.

The \noindent command below does what you'd expect:  it forces the current line/paragraph to not indent. See below and examples of commonly used symbols:

\noindent Exponent or Superscript written as `$x^2$` becomes $x^2$

\noindent Subscript written as `$x_1$` becomes $x_1$

\noindent Infinity written as `$\infty$` becomes $\infty$

\noindent alpha written as `$\alpha$` becomes $\alpha$

\noindent beta written as `$\beta$` becomes $\beta$

\noindent delta written as `$\delta$` becomes $\delta$

\noindent epsilon written as `$\epsilon$` becomes $\epsilon$

\noindent sigma written `$\sum_{i=1}^n f(x)$` becomes $\sum_{i=1}^n f(x)$
