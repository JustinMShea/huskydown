This is for including Chapter 1.  Notice that it's also good practice to name your chunk.  This will help you debug potential issues as you knit.  The chunk above is called intro and the one below is called background.  Feel free to change the name of the Rmd file as you wish, but don't forget to change it here from 01-background.Rmd.

The {#background} text after the chapter declaration will allow us to link throughout the document back to the beginning of of the background section.

# Background {#background .unnumbered}

This section provides a literature review that informs the reader in the following ways: 

* Provides background information so the reader may understand related concepts
* Identifies and defines concepts and variables involved and ummarizes what is known 
* Motivates the research and highlights its importance within the literature described 

**Introduction** 

* Define the focus: e.g., pricing models based on emerging market conditions
* Introduce the thesis: e.g., existing models are ex-post and there is a need for ex-ante

**Body** 

* Elaborate on the thesis 
* Review literature to substantiate your assumptions and build support for the thesis 
* Resolve conflicting findings to the thesis and formulate alternative theses 
* Discuss why the alternatives are not favored and Identify knowledge gaps 
* Identify and motivate the contribution of the research 
    
**Conclusion**

  * Summarize the evidence in support of your thesis 
  * Summarize why alternative theses are not favored 
  * State the research question and hypotheses
  
   _Research Question_
   
A research question is a more specific formulation of a purpose, where dependent and independent variables (and the relationship between them) are identified. The question is formulated using the operational definitions of the variables. The answer to the question is the knowledge the project aims to produce. The research question also identifies a population and audience of interest the findings will benefit. Make sure the research question is consistent with its purpose but not identical to it.

* Hypotheses are sets of elementary statements that jointly provide an answer to the research question 
* Hypotheses are contained within the research questionâ€”no new idea is introduced 
* Each hypothesis defines a relationship between dependent and independent variables (if applicable)
