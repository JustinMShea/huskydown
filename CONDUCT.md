# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we respect all people who 
contribute in good faith through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

Participation in this project should be fun and personally rewarding as well as be a harassment and discrimination free experience for all involved.

Unacceptable behavior by participants include generally being a jerk...so just be cool.

Obviously, project maintainers can remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct or in the spirit of the project. Same goes for project maintainers.

Instances of behavior one deems unacceptable may be reported by contacting the project maintainers.

This Code of Conduct is based on the Contributor Covenant (version 1.0.0, available at) but edited to grant more degrees of freedom while being more welcoming in nature.
